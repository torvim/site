ON FLASH

For the first five or six years when I started, I forbade myself to use flash, so that I had to learn with my bare eyes what the conditions were outside the camera. Then I bought a flash, and it changed everything. It’s fantastic. You can freeze the moment. Unless you’re in really good light, flash is the only way you can really capture it. I use it a lot, even during the day, just to remove shadows. It flattens everything and turns it straight into a photograph—a very two-dimensional thing.
